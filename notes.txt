msfcli
os library python
os.popen for getting output of os commands

nmap library for python 
	-O -n to get the OS of the machines, parse them and return the IP's with their OS version

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pexpect
	- Use to interact with command line applications

https://github.com/allfro/pymetasploit
	- wrapper around msfprc

Run from comprimise machine to expand throughout the network
	- run post/windows/gather/hashdump 
	- Gather the hashes
	- run nmap scan (on first comprimised machine)
	- collect IP's with probable susceptible OS's
	- run metasploit (use exploit/windows/smb/psexec)
	- should gain meterpreter shell if machine can be comprimised
	- repeat process

Hopes:
	- we can get hashes from the other comprimised machines onto the main machines process to add to the hash pool

Possible uses
	- getting as many hashes as possible before trying to crack hashes offline for better odds of a success, for later use in other methods
